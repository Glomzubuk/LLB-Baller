Lets you replace all ball types including candyball and nitro cuff (Excluding powerups)
This includes no mesh manipulation tools so if the model is too large/rotated wrongly you have to fix it in a 3d modeling program.
I suggest using blender exported models!
If parts of the model is missing when you import it try reducing its vertex count.

How to use the mod:
Place a model and/or a texture in the folder that represents the ball you want to replace, then hit install.

The model has to be .obj
The texture has to be .png or .dds
Naming does not matter.
Baller supports transparency which can be achieved by manipulating the alpha channel of the bottom left pixel on your texture.
red channel controls refraction strenght, green channel controls refraction multiplier.

Example of folder stucture for a candyball replacement
:candy
-> regular
---> lol.obj, funni.dds
